## _Max Fashion(Clone)_

Project: Cloning [Max Fashion](https://www.maxfashion.in/in/en/department/maxmen) site.

Max-Fashion is an E-Commerce website which was launched in UAE in 2004 while came in India in 2006 and expanded the roots in more than 60 cities of India. The website deals in multiple products for each segment from men to women, child to old; they also provide excellent range of over 3,000 styles every season, in brand 
new designs, silhouettes and fabrics. 

In this project we tried to utilize our learning outcomes of unit 1 and 2  of Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School. With our best efforts, we tried to clone the whole website replicating same UI and functionality as of the original with few changes.

## End Notes ðŸ§¾
In this project we tried to the best of our ability to replicate all the functionality and also nearly complete UI of the site. This was a great learning curve as initially it seemed imposible to acheive the objective but with time as we kept on learning new tools and technique during construct week we finally tasted the success in completing the project.

## Limitations
Only one page(Indian wear men) is responsive and few more functionalities can be added.
